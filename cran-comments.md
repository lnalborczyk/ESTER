## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the authors@R field from a as.person() call to a person() call

* Concerning the second request, I am not able to provide published references using information-criteria-based evidence ratios to do sequential testing, as ESTER is designed to be used as an experimental toolbox, allowing to explore the characteristics of such a procedure. In other words, there is no (to the best of my knowledge) published refrences on the topic yet. However, if the concerns was about the more general way of deriving evidence ratios from information criteria, references are provided in the doc of the ictab function.
  
## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), devel and release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
