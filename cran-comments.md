## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
- used https links instead of http links in the readme file
- removed the \code{} in the description file

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), devel and release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies.
