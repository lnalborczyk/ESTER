Authors@R: as.person("Ladislas Nalborczyk <ladislas.nalborczyk@gmail.com> [aut, cre]")
Description: An implementation of sequential testing that uses evidence ratios
    computed from so-called Akaike weights, based on either the Akaike
    Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
    It allows to do sequential testing on observed data and to study the behaviour
    of sequential evidence ratios on simulated data as well.
