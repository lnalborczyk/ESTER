Description: An implementation of sequential testing that uses evidence ratios
    computed from the weights of a set of models. These weights correspond either
    to Akaike weights computed from the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the
    Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and following Burnham & Anderson
    (2004, <doi:10.1177/0049124104268644>) recommendations, or to pseudo-BMA
    weights computed from the WAIC or the LOO-IC of models fitted
    with 'brms' and following Yao et al. (2017, <arXiv:1704.02030v3>).
